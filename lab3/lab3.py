### 1. Multiple choice

# 1.1. Two computerized players are playing a game. Player MM does minimax
#      search to depth 6 to decide on a move. Player AB does alpha-beta
#      search to depth 6.
#      The game is played without a time limit. Which player will play better?
#
#      1. MM will play better than AB.
#      2. AB will play better than MM.
#      3. They will play with the same level of skill.
ANSWER1 = 3

# 1.2. Two computerized players are playing a game with a time limit. Player MM
# does minimax search with iterative deepening, and player AB does alpha-beta
# search with iterative deepening. Each one returns a result after it has used
# 1/3 of its remaining time. Which player will play better?
#
#   1. MM will play better than AB.
#   2. AB will play better than MM.
#   3. They will play with the same level of skill.
